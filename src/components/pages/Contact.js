        <p> This website is a fight to ensure each and every citizen of the country gets his Right2Vote. And it is not limited to just the political election but each and every election be it housing society election, club election, professional body election or the national election. Nobody should be denied his Right2Vote due to his geographical location, his work commitments, his health issues, weather etc.
